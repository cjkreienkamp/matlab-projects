# MATLAB Projects Collection

This repository compiles MATLAB projects undertaken during my academic career, focusing on autonomous vehicle control, electric vehicle systems, and robotics. The projects demonstrate practical applications of MATLAB in these engineering domains.

## Featured Projects

### 1. FollowerStopper Controller for Autonomous Vehicles

**Description**: As part of the CAT Vehicle Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) program at the University of Arizona, I contributed to the development and analysis of the FollowerStopper controller. This velocity controller aims to mitigate stop-and-go traffic waves, enhancing safety and string stability in autonomous vehicles.

**Highlights**:
- Conducted safety and stability analyses to validate the controller's effectiveness.
- Co-authored a paper titled [Safety and Stability Analysis of the FollowerStopper Traffic Wave Dampening Controller](https://catvehicle.arizona.edu/safety-and-stability-analysis-followerstopper), published in the 2020 American Control Conference.

### 2. Introduction to Robotics Algorithms

**Description**: In the junior fall semester, I explored foundational robotics algorithms, including kinematics, path planning, and sensor integration. The project involved developing simulations to test robotic movements and interactions within controlled environments.

**Highlights**:
- Implemented forward and inverse kinematics for robotic manipulators.
- Developed path planning algorithms to navigate obstacles.
- Integrated sensor data to enhance robotic perception and decision-making.

**Relevant Files**: Located in the `Junior Fall/Intro to Robotics` directory.

### 3. Electric Vehicle Modeling and Simulation

**Description**: During my senior fall semester, I developed models and simulations for electric vehicles, focusing on battery management systems, powertrain dynamics, and energy efficiency. This project aimed to optimize performance and extend the lifespan of electric vehicle components.

**Highlights**:
- Designed battery management algorithms to monitor and control battery states.
- Simulated powertrain components to assess energy consumption and efficiency.
- Analyzed vehicle dynamics under various driving conditions to improve performance.
